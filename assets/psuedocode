<input type="button" value="Start the quiz" name="quiz" onclick="durationOfQuiz();">
gettingAnswers();//executed immediately and builds the questions on page
setTimeout(finishQuiz, 2 * 60 * 1000);//executed in 2 minutes and stops quiz

// set new submission
    localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
    
    // get most recent submission
    var lastUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
    userFirstNameSpan.textContent = lastUser.firstName;
    userLastNameSpan.textContent = lastUser.lastName;
    userEmailSpan.textContent = lastUser.email;
    userPasswordSpan.textContent = lastUser.password;
  }
});
