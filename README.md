# Quiz-Your-Coding-Knowledge
Quiz to refresh programming skills.
The purpose of this application is to quiz coding knowledge while also storing high scores using local storage. The criteria for this application is as follows:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
Unfortunately this application fails to meet all of the criteria. Due to time constraints, I was unable to properly code all of the functionality required of this application.
